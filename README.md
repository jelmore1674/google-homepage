This is my project for "The Odin Project". I am going to make the google
homepage. We shall see how this goes.

Updates:

<!-- 1. Got the header positioned close, still needs a few tweeks and got the profile
   image rounded.
2. Got the logo in the correct position.
3. Have the footer roughly laid out, still some position to improve on.
4. Still have to work on the form itself. Getting the search buttons placed and
   styled as well. -->

Okay I have completed this project. What I used was html and css. I did use mdn,
youtube, stack overflow, and a few of the dev tools to complete this project. I
think there are some things I could improve upon; however, I am still happy
about my progress! xD
